        <h1>McDonald's</h1>
        <p>
            McDonald's is one of the largest and most recognized fast-food chains globally, known for its iconic Golden Arches and a menu featuring burgers, fries, and other fast-food staples. Founded in 1940 as a barbecue restaurant by Richard and Maurice McDonald in San Bernardino, California, McDonald's was later transformed into the modern fast-food giant by Ray Kroc, who opened the first franchised McDonald's restaurant in 1955 in Des Plaines, Illinois.
